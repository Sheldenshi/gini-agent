# Operations

This document covers local install, runtime lifecycle, parallel smoke testing, and diagnostics.

## Install

One-line install:

```sh
curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Lilac-Labs/gini-agent/main/scripts/install.sh | bash
```

The installer detects OS and arch, installs Bun if missing, clones the runtime into `~/.gini/runtime`, installs dependencies, drops a `gini` wrapper at `~/.local/bin/gini`, ensures `~/.local/bin` is on `PATH`, and initializes the `default` instance under `~/.gini/instances/default/`. The wrapper defaults `GINI_INSTANCE=default` (override via `--instance` or the `GINI_INSTANCE` env var) so installed users land on `default`. Repo-clone developers running `bun run gini` get an instance auto-derived from the repo directory basename so each worktree is isolated by default.

On macOS, the installer also enables autostart for the `main` instance (LaunchAgents at `~/Library/LaunchAgents/ai.lilaclabs.gini.main.gateway.plist` and `…main.web.plist`) and opens the Gini webapp's `/setup` page in your default browser. From the browser you pick a provider (OpenAI API key or Codex `codex --login` auth), submit, and the runtime starts using it on the next request. Pass `--no-autostart` to skip the LaunchAgent step (you'll need to run `gini start` manually and visit `/setup` to configure a provider).

Why the browser flow: piped `curl … | bash` has no controlling terminal, so the legacy `gini setup` prompt would never run. The new flow makes the same UX work for both interactive and piped installs — the runtime comes up, the browser opens, and the user fills a form. For OpenAI, the setup endpoint writes your API key to `~/.gini/secrets.env` with mode 0600; the running gateway picks it up immediately (no restart), and the autostart plist's `EnvironmentVariables` is refreshed in the background so future launchd respawns retain the key. The key is never written to `config.json` and never leaves your machine except in API calls to OpenAI. For Codex, no token values are stored by gini — the runtime reads `~/.codex/auth.json` on demand.

The terminal-driven `gini setup` command remains available for interactive shells that prefer it.

LaunchAgent `PATH` and version managers: at `gini autostart enable` time, the plist's `PATH` is the base macOS set (bun's dir, `~/.local/bin`, `/usr/local/bin`, `/opt/homebrew/bin`, …) extended with the entries reported by your interactive `$SHELL`. This is what lets a launchd-supervised gateway see CLIs installed under per-user version managers — `~/.nvm/versions/node/<v>/bin`, `~/.asdf/shims`, `~/.volta/bin`, pyenv, rbenv, etc. — the same way your terminal does. If you later switch node versions, install a new path manager, or move a CLI to a different bin dir, re-run `gini autostart enable` to refresh the plist.

From source (for developers):

```sh
bun install
bun run gini install
```

Use Codex OAuth as the preferred interactive provider:

```sh
codex --login
bun run gini provider set codex gpt-5.5
bun run gini doctor
```

Gini reads Codex credentials from `CODEX_AUTH_JSON` or `~/.codex/auth.json` and does not write token values into Gini config.

OpenAI API keys are supported as a fallback:

```sh
export OPENAI_API_KEY=...
bun run gini provider set openai gpt-5.4-mini
bun run gini doctor
```

## Start And Stop

Persistent runtime:

```sh
bun run gini start
bun run gini status
bun run gini stop
```

Foreground runtime for development:

```sh
bun run gini run --instance feature-x
```

`start` and `run` print the runtime gateway URL and the Next.js web URL.

The production `default` instance (installed via `curl|bash`) is pinned to memorable ports:

- web: `http://127.0.0.1:7777`
- runtime: `http://127.0.0.1:7778`

Developer worktree instances (auto-derived from the repo directory basename when running `bun run gini`) get deterministic hash-derived ports within a 100-port window starting at 7337 (runtime) / 3000 (web), so parallel worktrees coexist without manual `--port` wrangling. `gini status` prints the live URLs.

## Parallel Smoke Tests

Smoke tests are isolated by default:

```sh
bun run gini smoke
```

Each smoke run creates an ephemeral instance under `/tmp`, chooses available localhost ports, uses deterministic echo model providers, exercises the real runtime/API, writes evidence, and stops the runtime afterward. Multiple coding agents can run smoke tests at the same time without sharing the `dev` instance.

For a named persistent test instance:

```sh
bun run gini smoke --instance codex-a --state-root /tmp/gini-codex-a --log-root /tmp/gini-codex-a-logs --port 7601
```

## Verification

```sh
bun run typecheck
bun test
bun run gini smoke
```

Common runtime checks:

```sh
bun run gini doctor
bun run gini evidence
```

## Update

To update an existing install:

```sh
gini update
```

Pulls the latest source into `~/.gini/runtime`, reinstalls dependencies, and leaves your state under `~/.gini/instances/` and the model cache at `~/.gini/models/` untouched. If a runtime is currently running, Gini restarts it automatically so the new code is picked up without a manual `gini stop && gini start`.

When the web app is running from the installer-managed runtime, its sidebar shows the current package/git version and exposes the same update action through its Update button.

`gini update` only operates on the installer-managed runtime at `~/.gini/runtime`. From a repo clone, use `git pull && bun install` instead.

## Local Development Install

If you're working on gini-agent itself and want to test the install/update/uninstall flow against your local checkout (without pushing to GitHub):

```sh
./scripts/install.sh --local
```

This is the same as the default install except it clones from your local repo into `~/.gini/runtime`. After you commit changes locally, `gini update` will pull them in. `gini uninstall` works exactly the same as a real install (same marker, same wrapper path).

## Agent Iteration Cap

The chat-task agent loop is bounded by a per-iteration cap that prevents
runaway tool-calling. The default is 90 iterations (one iteration = one
model call plus any tool dispatches that follow). Most tasks finish well
under 10 iterations; the cap exists as a safety bound, not a meaningful
budget for normal work.

Prior chat history replay is also bounded. The full chat remains stored,
but each new chat-task prompt packs prior rows under `agent.priorContextTokens`
before the current turn. When unset, the default is 65% of the effective
provider/model context window; unknown routed or local models fall back to a
conservative 32K window. Older omitted rows are still available through
Hindsight recall and exact `search_history`.

When the cap is hit the loop does NOT fail. Instead it makes one final
tool-less model call asking for a summary of what was learned and what
remained undone, and completes the task with that text. A warning trace
records the cap hit so the activity is auditable.

To override the cap for a single instance, edit
`~/.gini/instances/<instance>/config.json` and add an `agent` object:

```json
{
  "instance": "main",
  "port": 7337,
  "...": "...",
  "agent": {
    "maxIterations": 150,
    "priorContextTokens": 50000
  }
}
```

`maxIterations` and `priorContextTokens` must be positive integers.
Invalid values (zero, negative, non-numeric) fall back to their defaults
(`maxIterations` is built-in; `priorContextTokens` is provider-derived) and
emit a warning trace on the next task. The runtime reads
`config.json` once at server start and holds `RuntimeConfig` in memory,
so edits don't take effect until you restart `gini run` (stop the tmux
session and re-issue the command).

## Approval Settings

Controls live behind a single endpoint (`/api/settings/auto-approve`):

- **`approvalMode`** — `"strict" | "auto" | "yolo"`. New instances
  default to `"yolo"`; existing instances are not auto-escalated (a
  config that predates an explicit `approvalMode` keeps resolving to
  `"auto"`). `strict` gates every approval-eligible action
  (`file_write`, `file_patch`, `terminal_exec`, `code_exec`,
  `browser_upload_file`, `send_message`) for a human decision. `auto`
  auto-approves the safe set (including `send_message`) and gates
  `terminal_exec` / `code_exec` only when the command matches a
  dangerous-pattern entry. `yolo` bypasses every gate. See
  [ADR approval-mode.md](adr/approval-mode.md) for the full contract.

- **`autoApproveCommands` (shell-glob allowlist for `terminal_exec`).**
  Skip the human gate for specific shell commands the agent runs.
  Patterns are anchored on both ends (so `memo *` matches `memo notes
  -a` but NOT `rm -rf / && memo notes`); `*` and `?` use standard glob
  semantics, everything else is a literal match. An allowlist match
  ALWAYS short-circuits the dangerous-pattern blocklist — explicit
  operator allow beats heuristic block. Auto-approved commands still
  write a high-risk `terminal.exec` audit row with
  `evidence.autoApproved=true` and
  `evidence.autoApprovedReason=<pattern>`.

- **`dangerousTerminalPatterns`** — optional operator overlay that
  EXTENDS the built-in dangerous-pattern blocklist for `approvalMode:
  "auto"`. The built-ins (`rm -rf /` against system paths, any
  `sudo`, pipe-to-shell, `chmod 777`, destructive git, writes to
  `/etc/` and friends) always apply; operator entries add to them.
  An empty list keeps the built-ins. Only consulted in `"auto"` mode.

- **`dangerouslyAutoApprove`** — deprecated read alias for
  `approvalMode === "yolo"`. Returned as a derived boolean on GET;
  accepted on PATCH as a one-shot alias (`true` → `"yolo"`, `false`
  → `"auto"`). New configuration should prefer `approvalMode`.

Read current settings:

```sh
curl -s -H "Authorization: Bearer $TOKEN" http://127.0.0.1:7337/api/settings/auto-approve
```

Set patterns:

```sh
curl -X PATCH -H "Authorization: Bearer $TOKEN" -H "content-type: application/json" \
  -d '{"patterns": ["memo *", "remindctl *"]}' \
  http://127.0.0.1:7337/api/settings/auto-approve
```

Switch modes:

```sh
curl -X PATCH -H "Authorization: Bearer $TOKEN" -H "content-type: application/json" \
  -d '{"approvalMode": "yolo"}' \
  http://127.0.0.1:7337/api/settings/auto-approve
```

Any subset of fields can be set in a single PATCH; omitted keys keep
their current value. The endpoint persists to
`~/.gini/instances/<instance>/config.json` in one write and takes
effect immediately for new tool dispatches.

## Cleanup

Remove a single instance:

```sh
gini uninstall --instance <instance>
```

Full uninstall (interactive, two prompts):

```sh
gini uninstall
```

The first prompt asks "are you sure" (default no). The second asks whether to keep instance state at `~/.gini/instances/` (default yes). The full uninstall stops every running instance, removes the installer-managed wrapper at `~/.local/bin/gini`, removes the runtime checkout at `~/.gini/runtime/`, and strips the PATH block (marker `# Added by gini-agent installer`) from your shell rc. The model cache at `~/.gini/models/` is never auto-removed — the summary prints its size and the `rm -rf` command to remove it manually.

Non-interactive variants:

```sh
gini uninstall --yes      # full uninstall, no prompts, keep instances
gini uninstall --purge    # full uninstall + delete instances (implies --yes)
```

For disposable development and tests, override roots:

```sh
GINI_STATE_ROOT=.gini GINI_LOG_ROOT=.gini-logs bun run gini --instance sandbox smoke
```
