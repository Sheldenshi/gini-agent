# ADR: Model-First Selection (Models With Routes, Not Providers With Models)

## Decision

The web app selects models model-first: the user picks a **model**, and a
**provider is just a route that serves it**. Most models resolve to a default
route automatically; the user only chooses a provider when a model is
reachable through more than one connected provider.

Three pieces implement this:

1. **A model-major catalog view.** `buildModelCatalog` (`packages/runtime/src/model-routes.ts`)
   folds the configured slice of `providerCatalogWithStatus()` into
   `ModelCatalogEntry[]` — canonical model ids, each with its
   `ModelRoute[]` (`{ provider, providerModelId, label, default }`). Exposed
   at `GET /api/providers/models`. A hand-curated alias table maps
   provider-specific ids onto canonical ones (Bedrock cross-region inference
   profiles fold into the Claude ids they serve, with the geo surfaced as a
   route qualifier: "Amazon Bedrock · eu"). Default-route priority is the
   model vendor's own API first (`openai`, `anthropic`, `deepseek`), then
   `codex`, then the metered clouds (`azure`, `bedrock`), then the
   deliberate opt-ins (`openrouter`, `local`).
2. **One shared picker.** `packages/web/src/components/ModelPicker.tsx` renders a
   collapsed trigger leading with the serving route's brand icon and the
   model name, with the route spelled out ("gpt-5.5 · Codex") — the model
   name alone can't say whether gpt-5.5 rides Codex or OpenAI, so the route
   is always visible without opening the picker. The open state is a
   searchable list of model names,
   each row naming its serving route; a multi-route model adds a chevron,
   and hovering the row (or ArrowRight, or tapping the chevron — hover is
   unreachable on keyboard and touch) opens a side flyout of its routes,
   brand-iconed, with the default tagged. Picking a model name takes its
   default route; picking a route in the flyout takes that exact pair. The
   brand icons come from the shared `PROVIDER_ICONS` map
   (`packages/web/src/components/provider-logos.tsx`), which the Settings provider
   rows reuse. The same component serves the Settings page and the
   per-agent chat Settings tab.
3. **A default-model write path that updates both layers and detaches
   followers.** `setDefaultModel` (`packages/runtime/src/runtime/default-model.ts`), exposed
   at `POST /api/settings/default-model` with body `{ provider, model }`,
   writes `RuntimeConfig.provider` via `setSetupProvider` (preserving stored
   transport config on a same-provider save) **and** mirrors the persisted
   pair onto the default agent's override via `setAgentProvider`. The
   default agent is resolved the same way the boot seeding does —
   `agent_default`, or the legacy pre-rename `profile_default` id.
4. **Agents are snapshots, never live links.** Changing the default must
   not rewrite the model an existing agent runs on. An agent carrying an
   override is untouched; an agent WITHOUT one — which resolves through
   `config.provider` live (the runtime fallback contract of ADR
   per-agent-provider-settings.md, unchanged) — is pinned by
   `setDefaultModel` to the pair it was resolving to before the change.
   Adopting a newer default is an explicit act: the chat tab's "Use default
   model" copies the current default pair onto the agent as a new pin (it
   never clears the override), so the agent stays unsynced from future
   default changes.

The Settings page's per-provider "active" radio is replaced by a "Default
model" control at the top of the providers area; the provider rows remain
for credential management only (edit transport config, disconnect, add).

## Context

Selection was provider-first: the Settings page staged an "active provider"
radio that wrote `config.provider`, and the per-agent Settings tab picked a
provider row first, then a model from that provider's list. Two problems:

- **The mental model was inverted.** Users think in models ("use
  claude-sonnet-4-6"), and the same model is often reachable through several
  connected providers (first-party Anthropic and Bedrock; gpt-5.5 via Codex
  and Azure). Provider-first UI made the common case (pick a model) two
  decisions deep and hid the equivalence between routes.
- **The "active provider" radio was inert for the default chat.**
  `seedDefaultAgentFromConfig` (`packages/runtime/src/state/store.ts`) seeds `agent_default`'s
  override from `config.provider` on boot, and that override wins in
  `resolveEffectiveContext` from then on. Writing only `config.provider`
  (all the radio did) therefore did not change what the default chat — or
  new agents, which copy `agent_default`'s pair at creation — actually used.
  The two-layer write in `setDefaultModel` is what makes "Default model"
  mean what it says.

## Canonical Model Identity

There is no upstream source of truth for "these provider-specific ids are
the same model", so the mapping is a small hand-curated table in
`packages/runtime/src/model-routes.ts` — explicit alias entries only, no prefix-stripping
heuristics, so a new catalog id can never silently merge with the wrong
model. Unaliased ids (Nova, Llama, Mistral profiles, `openrouter/auto`)
surface verbatim as their own single-route entries. Adding a catalog model
that exists under another provider means adding its alias entry; the
`model-routes.test.ts` catalog-drift test pins the aliased ids to the real
catalog.

## Read And Write Paths

- The picker's list comes from `GET /api/providers/models` (BFF-proxied like
  every `/api/runtime/*` read; no credentials involved — route labels and
  ids only, see ADR bff-trust-boundary.md).
- **Settings "Default model"** reads `agent_default`'s pair from
  `GET /api/agents` (falling back to the instance provider pre-seed) and
  writes `POST /api/settings/default-model`. Reading `agent_default` — not
  `config.provider` — keeps the display honest: it is what new chats start
  with even when another surface (CLI `gini provider set`, the Edit dialog,
  add-provider) has moved `config.provider` underneath it.
- **Chat Settings tab** reads `/api/status.activeAgent.resolvedProvider`.
  For a non-default agent it writes the existing
  `POST /api/agents/:id/provider` contract (ADR
  per-agent-provider-settings.md) with the route pair; "Use default model"
  writes the CURRENT default pair as a new pin (the endpoint's blank-pair
  clear remains an API affordance the UI no longer uses). For the DEFAULT
  agent — whose pair is the default model itself — picks route through
  `POST /api/settings/default-model` instead, so the mirror with
  `config.provider` holds no matter which surface the default was changed
  from. Selection applies immediately on pick — no staged save bar.
- Routes are derived only from **configured** providers, so the picker never
  offers a route the next turn can't authenticate. Azure's configured-gate
  (active instance provider only) means a cross-provider Azure override
  still can't be picked, same as before.
- An off-catalog selection (custom Bedrock/local id set elsewhere) renders
  on the trigger as `model · provider`; entering new custom ids stays in the
  provider Edit dialog.

## Consequences

- "Default model" now actually changes the default chat and what new agents
  inherit; previously only a per-agent save did.
- `config.provider` remains the transport/credential anchor: embeddings and
  the reranker keep reading it (ADR agents-replace-profiles.md), the Edit
  provider dialog still writes its model field as the instance fallback, and
  removal of the provider backing it stays blocked in the UI.
- Changing the default model never rewrites an existing agent: pinned
  agents keep their pair, and previously override-less agents are pinned to
  the prior default by the write itself. Their chat Settings tab shows their
  own selection with an explicit "Use default model" pin action.
- Two routes can share a provider (Bedrock geo profiles); a route label is
  therefore provider label + qualifier, and the picker treats the pair
  `(provider, providerModelId)` — not the provider name — as the selection
  unit.
- The CLI `gini provider set` still writes only `config.provider`; aligning
  it with the two-layer default-model write is future work.

## Acceptance Checks

- `GET /api/providers/models` returns only configured providers' routes;
  with Bedrock connected, the Claude geo profiles fold into canonical
  entries with geo-qualified Bedrock routes.
- `POST /api/settings/default-model { provider, model }` updates
  `config.provider` (persisted) AND `agent_default.providerName/model`; a
  rejected provider save (missing key, unsupported name) leaves the agent
  untouched.
- The Default model trigger always names the serving route ("gpt-5.5 ·
  Codex") with its brand icon; picking a model via a flyout route shows
  that exact route's label.
- In the chat Settings tab, picking a model + non-default route persists the
  exact pair on the agent and the next chat turn dispatches through it.
- The picker is operable by keyboard (arrows + ArrowRight into the flyout +
  Enter) and by tap (chevron button opens the flyout).
- `bun run typecheck`, `bun run test`, and `bun run gini smoke` are green.
