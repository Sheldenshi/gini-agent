// APNs push registration + tap / action handling for the iOS app.
// This module is iOS-only — Android/web call sites must gate on
// Platform.OS first.
//
// Lifecycle:
//   1. The chat detail screen calls `registerForPushAsync()` the first
//      time it mounts. Asking permission at the first chat moment
//      gets noticeably higher grant rates than asking on app launch.
//   2. We request notification permission (idempotent — iOS only
//      shows the prompt once).
//   3. On grant, fetch the raw APNs device token via
//      `Notifications.getDevicePushTokenAsync()`. This is the
//      hex-encoded APNs token, NOT the Expo Push token — we send
//      directly to APNs from the gateway.
//   4. POST the token to `/api/push/devices` so the gateway can fan
//      `authorization_requested` notifications out to it.
//   5. Subscribe to `addPushTokenListener` so a rotated token
//      (rare, but happens on restore-from-backup) re-registers.
//   6. Subscribe to `addNotificationResponseReceivedListener` for tap +
//      action handling. The category registered below pairs with the
//      NSE attached on the server-side `authorization_requested` payload —
//      the OS shows Approve / Deny buttons on the lock screen, and
//      this listener routes each action to the right
//      /api/authorizations endpoint without forcing the app to foreground.
//
// Action handling caveat: `opensAppToForeground: false` means the OS
// only invokes the response listener if the app is backgrounded
// (suspended). If the user has fully killed the app from the app
// switcher, the action button still posts the response, but our
// listener never runs because there's no JS to run. Apple does not
// expose a way around this for non-foregrounding actions. The user
// must open the app and approve from there. The approval remains
// pending in the runtime until acted on — the runtime does not have
// a retry loop that re-emits approval requests.
//
// Idempotency: the gateway's POST handler is an upsert. Calling
// register multiple times (e.g. across screen mounts) is safe — the
// row's `last_seen_at` is bumped and nothing else changes.
