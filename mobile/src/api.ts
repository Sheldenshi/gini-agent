  // native read. The timer would fire, the controller would abort, yet
  // `await fetch(...)` / `await response.text()` would never settle, leaving
  // the query pending and the list screen's spinner up until a force-quit.
  // Racing the request against `deadline.promise` makes api() settle when the
  // timer rejects the deadline, regardless of whether the fetch promise ever
  // does. controller.abort() is still fired so a cancellation-honoring

  // to release native resources.

  // The deadline also covers BOTH the fetch AND the body read: winter fetch
  // resolves the Response as soon as headers arrive and streams the body

  // otherwise hang forever on response.text(). The single deadline spans the
  // whole request, so a stall at either stage settles via the race.
