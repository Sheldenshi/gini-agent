/**
 * Keeps a scroll container pinned to its newest content via an end-sentinel
 * `<div ref>` placed after the last item.
 *
 * The point of the hook is the *first* scroll: when a transcript opens (agent
 * switch, channel open, thread open) its viewport mounts at scrollTop 0, so a
 * `behavior: "smooth"` scroll there makes the user watch the list animate
 * up-from-top down to the bottom. Instead, the first snap for a given view runs
 * with `behavior: "auto"` inside a layout effect — it lands at the bottom
 * before the browser paints, so the transcript simply opens already scrolled
 * down.
 *
 * `itemCount` is the trigger: the effect re-evaluates only when it changes, so
 * pass the rendered item/block count. A later count change within the same view
 * follows the bottom — but only while the user is still pinned there. If they
 * have scrolled up to read history, a new block (a streamed reply, or a message
 * arriving on a live relay) must NOT yank them back down. "Pinned" is sampled
 * from a scroll listener so the read happens *before* the new block grows the
 * content; measuring in the layout effect would see the already-appended block
 * and misjudge a pinned user as scrolled-up. This fires per new block, not per
 * streamed token — assistant text accretes in place under a stable block id
 * without changing the count, so intra-message streaming does not re-scroll.
 *
 * Every scroll here is instant (`behavior: "auto"`), never smooth. An animated
 * follow IS the visible scrolling this hook exists to suppress; worse, a
 * smooth scroll's in-flight position is reported by the scroll listener and
 * would corrupt the pinned sample for the next block arriving mid-animation,
 * leaving a pinned user stranded short of the bottom.
 *
 * "First for a given view" is tracked by `key`: pass a stable conversation id
 * so a reused instance (the cross-agent thread inbox opens different threads in
 * one panel) re-arms the instant snap when the id changes. The first snap
 * always lands at the bottom regardless of scroll position. Pass `enabled:
 * false` while the view is hidden or empty (e.g. a non-active chat tab) so
 * background growth doesn't consume the instant-snap latch — it re-arms on the
 * next enable so returning to the view snaps instantly too.
