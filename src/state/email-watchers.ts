// Email watcher state helpers (ADR email-watch.md, ADR job-pre-run-hooks.md).
//
// An EmailWatcherRecord is a durable per-(account, sender-query) watcher. ALL of
// an agent's watchers share ONE backing interval-driven cron job and ONE chat
// session ("Email watch"): the shared job's `skill-script` preRunHook runs the
// gmail-watch detection script over a LIST of the enabled watches each tick, and
// matches across all senders land in the one shared thread (each labeled by
// sender). Adding the first watcher provisions the shared job + session; adding
// more reuses them and rebuilds the job's watch list; removing the last enabled
// watcher tears the shared job + session down UNLESS the agent has opted into
// whole-inbox triage (which keeps the job alive on its own — opting into triage
// also provisions the job up front when no targeted watcher exists);
// disable/enable rebuilds the watch list (the job watches only ENABLED watchers). These helpers follow the
// createXRecord convention in records.ts: the builder mutates a RuntimeState in
// place and emits an audit row; the config-level wrappers go through mutateState
// so all state I/O serializes through the per-instance lock. Job lifecycle
// helpers are imported lazily (dynamic import) so this state module doesn't close
// a static cycle with src/jobs (which imports src/state).
