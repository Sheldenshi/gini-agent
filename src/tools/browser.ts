//
// When RuntimeConfig.browserRecording is true (server boot calls
// setBrowserRecording), browser sessions record a Playwright trace for
// debugging/audit review. Tracing (context.tracing start/stop) is used
// instead of recordVideo because video must be configured when the
// context is CREATED — impossible for the spawned persistent context, which
// is launched before any task exists — while tracing can start on an
// already-live context. The
// BrowserContext is shared across tasks (one per instance), so only one trace
// runs at a time: the first session created while none is active claims it;
// sessions starting while a trace is in flight are simply not recorded.
//
// Trace archives are raw Playwright captures (DOM snapshots +
// screenshots) and do NOT pass through the secret-redaction layer — they
// can contain anything the page displayed. They are written only to local
// disk under <instanceRoot>/browser-traces/, never enter the model
// context, and every save writes a browser.trace_saved audit row. That is
