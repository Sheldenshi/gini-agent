// final answer as a standalone bubble. The grouping is identical while the
// turn streams and after it settles (the process reads the same the whole way
// through, so no steps reflow when the turn finishes). What differs is
// presentation: an in-flight group (`inProgress`) renders expanded so the user
// watches each tool call land as it happens, then collapses to the one-line
// summary once the turn completes. The generated-files card likewise waits
// until the turn is complete. A turn with no tool calls passes its blocks

// only set on a standalone assistant_text that comes after the last tool call
// (or the lone reply of a no-tool turn). A forwarded Topic turn's per-iteration
// narration is NOT the final answer, so its "# topic" deep-link chip is
// suppressed; only the final answer carries it.
