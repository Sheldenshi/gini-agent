// macOS LaunchAgent integration: write a per-instance plist set (gateway +
// web), register them with `launchctl bootstrap gui/<uid>`, and tear them
// down with `launchctl bootout`.
//
// What this exists for: after `gini install` runs, the user expects BOTH the
// runtime gateway AND the Next.js webapp to be running and to stay running
// across crashes and logins. On macOS the supported way to achieve that for
// a per-user, foreground-session service is a user-domain LaunchAgent under
// ~/Library/LaunchAgents/. System daemons (~/.../Library/LaunchDaemons/)
// can't reach the user's Keychain, which would break Codex auth.
//
// Three plists per instance:
//   - `<prefix>.<instance>.gateway`  — the Bun runtime (src/server.ts)
//   - `<prefix>.<instance>.web`      — Next.js dev server, gated on the
//                                      gateway's /api/healthz coming up
//   - `<prefix>.<instance>.watchdog` — long-lived health-probe loop that
//                                      revives a dead/hung gateway/web
//
// Scope notes:
//   - macOS only in v1. Linux systemd --user parity is a follow-up.
//   - KeepAlive only reacts to process exit, so the watchdog covers the gaps
//     it can't: a wedged-but-alive runtime (hits /api/status and
//     /api/runtime/__healthz, kickstarts whatever is hung) and a clean exit
//     that launchd defers respawning. See ADR always-up-supervision.md.
//   - KeepAlive is `true`: launchd always respawns the service on exit, so
//     the runtime stays up across crashes AND clean exits (an auto-update
//     self-SIGTERM respawns with the fresh code). Stopping is done out of
//     band: `gini stop` runs `launchctl bootout` to unload the service.
//
// Layering: the label/path/service-target derivation and the thin shellouts
// to `launchctl` live in src/integrations/launchd.ts so src/runtime/* can
// import them without depending on src/cli/*. This module re-exports them
// for back-compat with existing test imports.

  // KeepAlive contract:

  //     up", so a clean exit (e.g. an auto-update self-SIGTERM) is treated
  //     as "respawn with the fresh code", not "the user is done".
  //   - Stopping is therefore an out-of-band action: `gini stop` runs
  //     `launchctl bootout` to unload the service so KeepAlive no longer
  //     applies. We never rely on a clean exit to keep the service down.
  //   - ThrottleInterval:10 caps crashloop CPU — KeepAlive:true means a
  //     crash loop would otherwise respawn as fast as the process dies.
  //   - RunAtLoad:true means it starts at user login.
  //
  // NetworkState was considered (would gate first-boot launches until the
  // network came up) but launchd treats NetworkState as a *pended-spawn
  // semaphore*: even after a non-zero exit, the next spawn waits for a
  // network-state transition, which doesn't fire when the network was
  // already up. Empirically that prevents respawn-after-SIGKILL entirely.
  // The runtime tolerates a network-not-yet-up startup (provider auth
  // retries with backoff), so dropping NetworkState gets us reliable
  // crash respawn.
  //
  // Scheduling block differs by job shape:
  //   - Long-lived (gateway/web/watchdog): KeepAlive:true + ThrottleInterval.
  //     launchd always respawns on exit; bootout is the stop. The watchdog is
  //     long-lived too — its probe cadence is an in-process loop, NOT launchd
  //     StartInterval respawns, because launchd's spawn deferral (macOS 26)
  //     gapped StartInterval ticks during the very gateway outages the
  //     watchdog exists to cover.
  //   - Periodic (startIntervalSeconds set): StartInterval + RunAtLoad and NO
  //     KeepAlive — for a short-lived job that exits after each run, where
  //     KeepAlive would respawn it in a tight loop. No current kind uses this
  //     shape; the machinery stays for future periodic jobs.
