# Google Docs

Use `gws docs` to create blank documents, read existing document content, append text, and run structured batch updates against the Docs v1 API. This is the **content** surface for Google Docs — for the file as an object (sharing, copying, moving, trashing) use `google-drive` instead.

## Prerequisites

- `gws` installed and authenticated. If `gws` is not on PATH OR `gws auth status` reports no authenticated user, do NOT silently call setup. Instead, in a single short reply to the user:
  1. State plainly what's missing — e.g. "Google Workspace access isn't set up on this machine yet" or "your Google sign-in has expired."
  2. Ask one sentence: "Want me to walk you through setting it up?" Wait for the user's answer.
  3. If they say yes, call `read_skill` with name `google-workspace-setup` and run that skill's onboarding flow turn-by-turn. If they say no or ask to defer, acknowledge briefly and stop — do not retry the original request.
- Apply the same flow when any `gws docs ...` call fails mid-task with `command not found` / ENOENT, HTTP 401, "no credentials", or "scope required". Don't report the failure as a dead end — surface the missing prerequisite and ask if the user wants to set it up before moving on.
- OAuth scopes the user picked at login must cover the verbs the agent will use:
  - Read and edit Docs: `docs`
  - Find docs by title (or list recent docs) before reading: pair with `drive.readonly`

## When to Use

- The user asks Gini to read, draft, or edit the **body** of a Google Doc.
- Appending notes, meeting summaries, or AI-generated content to an existing doc.
- Creating a new blank doc as a starting point (then editing it with `+write` or `batchUpdate`).
- Running structured edits (insert text at index, replace all of a string, apply heading styles) via the `batchUpdate` API.

## When NOT to Use

- Sharing, moving, renaming, copying, trashing, or permission-managing a doc — use `google-drive` for the file-as-object surface.
- Spreadsheets — use Sheets (`gws sheets ...`), not Docs.
- Slide decks — use Slides (`gws slides ...`), not Docs.
- Personal cross-device notes — use `apple-notes` or `obsidian`; a Google Doc is overkill and slower to sync.
- Agent-internal scratch state — use the `memory` tool.
- Long-form Markdown the user maintains locally — keep it in the repo or vault. Docs is for content that needs collaborative editing or live sharing.

## Quick Reference

The Docs surface has only three top-level methods (`documents.get`, `documents.create`, `documents.batchUpdate`) plus a `+write` helper for the common "append text" case.

### Create a blank doc

```bash
gws docs documents create --json '{"title":"Weekly notes"}'
```

The response includes a `documentId` you will need for subsequent reads and writes. Other fields in the request (body, settings, …) are ignored by `documents.create` — set them with a follow-up `batchUpdate` call.

### Read a doc

```bash
gws docs documents get --params '{"documentId":"<DOC_ID>"}'
```

The response is the full structured Docs JSON tree (`body.content[]` of paragraph, table, sectionBreak, etc. elements). For a plain-text dump, pipe through `jq`:

```bash
gws docs documents get --params '{"documentId":"<DOC_ID>"}' \
  | jq -r '.body.content[].paragraph?.elements[]?.textRun?.content // empty'
```

### Append text (helper)

```bash
gws docs +write --document <DOC_ID> --text 'Hello, world!'
gws docs +write --document <DOC_ID> --text "$(cat ./notes.md)"
```

`+write` inserts the given text at the end of the document body. For anything richer (bold, headings, bullet lists, replace-all, table insert) drop to `documents.batchUpdate`.

### Structured edits (`batchUpdate`)

The Docs API edits a doc as an ordered list of `requests`. Each request is one mutation. The whole batch is atomic — if any request is invalid, nothing is applied.

```bash
# Insert text at a specific index
gws docs documents batchUpdate \
  --params '{"documentId":"<DOC_ID>"}' \
  --json '{
    "requests": [
      {"insertText": {"location": {"index": 1}, "text": "Heading\n"}}
    ]
  }'

# Replace every occurrence of a placeholder
gws docs documents batchUpdate \
  --params '{"documentId":"<DOC_ID>"}' \
  --json '{
    "requests": [
      {"replaceAllText": {
         "containsText": {"text": "{{NAME}}", "matchCase": true},
         "replaceText": "Alice"
      }}
    ]
  }'

# Apply heading style to a range
gws docs documents batchUpdate \
  --params '{"documentId":"<DOC_ID>"}' \
  --json '{
    "requests": [
      {"updateParagraphStyle": {
         "range": {"startIndex": 1, "endIndex": 8},
         "paragraphStyle": {"namedStyleType": "HEADING_1"},
         "fields": "namedStyleType"
      }}
    ]
  }'
```

For schema details on each request type, inspect the method:

```bash
gws schema docs.documents.batchUpdate
```

### Find a doc by title before reading

Use `google-drive` to locate the doc, then hand the ID to `gws docs`:

```bash
gws drive files list \
  --params '{"q":"mimeType = '\''application/vnd.google-apps.document'\'' and name contains '\''Weekly notes'\''"}'
```

## Rules

1. Every `documents.create`, `documents.batchUpdate`, and `+write` call is a write. Confirm target document, content, and (for `batchUpdate`) the request list before invoking, even when `gws *` is auto-approved.
2. `documents.create` only accepts `title` — body content, settings, and permissions are ignored. To populate a new doc, follow create with `+write` or `batchUpdate`.
3. `batchUpdate` is atomic across all requests in the array. Build the full request list, send it once, and check the reply rather than retrying mid-batch on partial failure.
4. Index math on `batchUpdate` is brittle — every text insertion shifts the indices of subsequent content. When making multiple inserts, either order requests from highest index to lowest, or use `replaceAllText` (which is index-agnostic) when possible.
5. For sharing, copying, moving, renaming, or trashing a doc — switch to `google-drive`. Docs only owns the body; Drive owns the file.
6. For personal note-taking that should sync across the user's devices outside Google's ecosystem, prefer `apple-notes` or `obsidian` over creating a Google Doc. Use Docs when the user needs collaborative editing or live sharing.
7. When dumping body text via `jq`, the path above only catches paragraph-level `textRun` content. Tables, footnotes, headers/footers, and embedded objects live in other branches of the tree — for a faithful export, use Drive's `files.export` with `mimeType: text/plain` instead.

For flags not shown here, run `gws docs --help` or `gws schema docs.<resource>.<method>` to inspect a specific API method.
